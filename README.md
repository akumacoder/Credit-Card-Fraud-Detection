Credit Card Fraud Detection using Machine Learning

1). Built an end-to-end fraud detection system on a highly imbalanced real-world credit card transactions dataset

2). Applied SMOTE to handle class imbalance and prevent biased learning

3). Trained and evaluated models with XGBoost and Logistic Regression

4). Focused on ROC-AUC, Precision, Recall, and F1-score instead of misleading accuracy

5). Used decision threshold tuning to simulate realistic fraud detection behavior

6). Visualized performance using Confusion Matrix, ROC Curve, and Precision–Recall Curve
